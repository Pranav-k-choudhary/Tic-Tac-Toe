# How It Works
- The game starts with Player O.
- Players take turns clicking on empty boxes to place their mark (O  or X).
- The game automatically checks for a winner after each move.
- If a player gets three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win.
- If all cells are filled and no one wins, we can reset the game.

# Buttons Functionality
- New Game -> Starts a completely fresh game and clears the board.
- Reset Game -> Resets the current game board.
- Undo -> Reverts the last move made by the player.
